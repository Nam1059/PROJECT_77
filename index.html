        <p>This is my project on Console.
           In this project I am going to write about visual Studio code.</p>
        <p>About VSC : 
            Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.
             It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE.
             Robust and extensible architecture# Architecturally, Visual Studio Code combines the best of web, native, and language-specific technologies.
             Using Electron, VS Code combines web technologies such as JavaScript and Node.
             js with the speed and flexibility of native apps.
